# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021]. They're all written in JS so
far.

## Notes

- I created the input files like so:
    - Copied and pasted them from the AOC website into a file.
	- In Vim, started a recording buffer and transformed the first line into a
	  format that I thought might be the most useful.
	- Applied that buffer to every single line.
	- Added whatever crap around it I needed to make it a valid, exportable JS
	  file.
- [Thilina] helped me with Day 8 Part 2.  [Here][thilina-day8-part2] is his
  solution.
